# PowerPath-V1-Code-


The Code starts at Main and then later version have main v1 v2 etc 


main 

is the base 


main v1 

has an updated ADC measurement where the cell 1 middle voltage is incorporated into the code 


main v2

incorporated an external interrupt service routine connected to the coulomb counter. Needs to add in I2C communication for Amperage here

main v3

currently being revised but has code to work on a balancing algorithm  

functionsshrunk

this code has shrunk down the i2c functions so the code can be more concise it will be added into a V4 which is the same as V3 with this change made.
